# Overview

We were tasked with creating an educational platform for lifelong learners, offering personalized learning experiences. We needed to implement design options to integrate AI-driven recommendations that encourage users to explore new subjects and skills at their own pace.

# Criteria

The criteria for the project was as follows:
1. Prompt alignment - Team thoroughly explained how their tool/product/website meets the prompt criteria.
2. Competitor + user research - Team conducted effective user and competitor research, clearly shared their findings, and incorporated those findings into their final product.
3. User persona(s) - Team developed at least one user persona and explained how the persona was developed from their research.
4. Code execution - Team has ensured that the program is functional and refined, with features that meet or exceed the prompt requirements.
5. Code reflection - Team can explain how their code works.
6. Visual design & branding - Team’s final product has coherent, intuitive, and research-driven visual design that follows best UI practices, and created new branding and articulated their rationale for doing so.
7. High-fidelity mockups - Team produced high-fidelity mockups based on their research and wireframes with particular attention to detail.
8. High-fidelity working prototype - Team created a high-fidelity working prototype that effectively integrated all their ideas in a way that would resonate with the target audience.
9. 15-minute presentation - Team’s presentation was organized, clear, compelling, and 15 minutes long.
